Tools
=====

Each view in MapX offers a series of tools which allow among other
things to configure it or to interact with the data. The number of tools
available for a view varies according to its type and the user's role in
the project.

Here is the complete list of tools that you will encounter when using
MapX (some tools are described in detail in dedicated pages or later in
this one):

.. csv-table:: Tools
   :file: ./csv/tools.csv
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 23, 8, 14, 15, 40
   :class: longtable

\* vt = vector; rt = raster; sm = story map; cc = custom code; lg = local
GeoJSON

\*\* access to these tools will depend on the rights specified in the view
and your role in the project
