Sharing a story map
===================

You can use the **Sharing manager** to generate a link and share it on
social media or by email. The use of this tool is described in details
in the :doc:`Sharing manager <../user-interface/sharing-manager>` section.
We recommend that you share story maps in static mode (default mode) which
allows them to be read automatically when the link is opened.

The **Sharing manager** is also available in the menu bar when the story
map is played. This way, readers can either share the story map itself
or share the views displayed in the map for a given step.
