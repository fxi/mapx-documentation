How to tell a great story?
==========================

A great story map is visually appealing, simple, focused, and flows both
seamlessly and logically.

First, think about your audience. Before you build your story map, think
about who you want to reach, what you want your key messages to be, and
how the audience may find it meaningful. Do you want to raise awareness,
be informative or catalyze action? Craft your text, maps, and other
content to suit your audience and your objectives. Avoid jargon and
acronyms that might be confusing to viewers unfamiliar with the topic of
your story.

Next, think about your text, including the title and subtitles. It
should be simple, clear, and compelling. The more you focus on essential
elements, the more likely you are to tell an effective story. A person
should not have to get to the fifth or sixth section in your story to
understand its concepts and objectives.

In any medium, a good story typically has: 

- Characters (i.e., a human face)
- A challenge to be faced
- Action
- A turning point when change happens
- A resolution
