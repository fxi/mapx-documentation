Story maps
==========

Story maps are a simple yet powerful tool to inform, engage, and inspire
your audience with any story you may want to tell. Story maps are an
effective way to harness the power of maps and geo-spatial
visualization, bring data to life and make stories often hidden in data
accessible to both the wider public or to a targeted audience including
policy makers.

A story map is a combination of a narrative, photos, and videos with
interactive maps. The MapX story map engine allows publishers of the
platform to independently build story maps without any GIS or
programming skills. Story maps can cover a wide variety of subjects and
tell any type of story.

This chapter aims to provide MapX users with technical guidance on how
to build a successful story map that is both interesting and
informative. Furthermore, it includes the step-by-step procedure to
build a story map.
