Recommendations for story map development
=========================================

-  Develop story maps with 15 to 20 steps.
-  Craft your title to be intriguing and descriptive.
-  Begin with an introductory paragraph that summarizes the story and
   its conclusion. Try to include basic answers to the questions of
   "why, who, what, when, where." The reader should have a good idea of
   what took place after reading this paragraph.
-  Provide more details in the following paragraphs, elaborating on the
   brief information in the first paragraph.
-  Catch the audience's interest: use maps, images, key figures etc.
-  Make sure the maps you use show quality data, have appropriate
   styling and complete metadata.
-  Make your titles and subtitles active, engaging, and concise.
-  Personalize your story: add pictures, citations, interviews, videos
   etc.
-  Give proper citation to maps, quotes and media used in the story map.
-  Write short paragraphs - try to keep them under 100 words.
-  Adapt the amount of text depending on its end-use: more text would be
   fine for online reading where less text would be appropriate if you
   plan to use this as a presentation.
-  Give a voice to your story: call to action at the end of your story
   map if necessary
-  Add a last step containing credits, contacts, organization logos, and
   if necessary, links to relevant external resources.
-  Test your story map on different screen sizes and different devices
   (computer, tablet, smartphone): what looks great on one screen
   doesn't necessarily look great on another. This is particularly true
   between computer screens and mobile phones.
-  Ensure that media loads quickly. For instance, it may take several
   seconds or even several minutes to load a 10MB image depending on the
   users internet connection. We recommend using photos with a file size
   less than 1MB.
