Metadata
========

The **MapX Metadata Standard**, which was developed by the MapX team, is
an extension of the ISO standard for describing geographic information
(`ISO 19115-1:2014 <https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html>`__). It
provides information about the identification, the content, the spatial
and temporal aspects, the license, and other properties of a dataset.
Moreover, some descriptive elements can be filled in all the languages
supported by MapX.
