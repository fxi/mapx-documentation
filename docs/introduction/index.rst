Introduction
============

`MapX <https://unepgrid.ch/en/mapx>`__ is an open-source online
application for managing and visualizing geospatial data on natural
resources, developed by `UNEP/GRID-Geneva <https://unepgrid.ch/en>`__, a
data centre resulting from the partnership between UN Environment
Programme (UNEP), the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, and the
University of Geneva. Field applications of MapX are varied and include
biodiversity planning, chemicals management, climate change, disaster
risk reduction, environmental security, extractive industries, land use
planning, and renewable energy, but they are not limited to these
topics. MapX targets a wide community of users that are primarily UNEP,
the Secretariats of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and
other UN agencies mandated to collect and use geospatial data in
environmental decision making. Civil society groups, non-governmental
organizations, academia and citizens complement this set of users. MapX
was designed in 2014 and since then continuously improved with wide
international stakeholder consultations.
