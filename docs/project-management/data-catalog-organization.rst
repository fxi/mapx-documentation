Data catalog organization
=========================

Administrators can define the default organization of the data catalog
in their project. This includes sorting of views and grouping in
categories and subcategories (detailed explanations
:ref:`here <sorting-views>`). To do so, administrators must first organize
the data catalog as they wish and then save its state using
the **Save views list state** tool available in the **Toolbox**.
Thus, users connecting to the project will see the organization as thought
by the administrators but will still have the possibility of modifying it
for their personal session in MapX (see :ref:`Sorting views <sorting-views>`).
