Project management
==================

Administrators are in charge within a project of managing user roles as
well as configuring its settings (e.g., title, abstract, countries
highlighting, map projection, default map position). They are also
responsible for establishing a work strategy within the project and
verifying the content that has been published.

Tools for managing projects and users are described in the following
